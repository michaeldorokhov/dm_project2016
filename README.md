### The Story

[Eurovision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest) is an annual international TV song contest, first help in 1956. Every year it is watched by at least 100 million of people all over the world. The winner is determined by combining the votes from national juries and televoting. In the recent years many have noticed the trend of countries voting not for a specific performer, but according to their sympathy to other countries, mainly to neighbors. We decided to take a look on the Eurovision data and reveal the truth.

### Approach

We used *descriptive analysis*, *data visualisation* on a map and *complete-link hierarchical clustering* that produced a dendrogram with countries clusters. The same code could be modified so you can achieve the same results for your country!

### Results

Check out the [poster](img/Project_Poster.png) and the [leaflet](img/Project_Leaflet.png) of the project.
